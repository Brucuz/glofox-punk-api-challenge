# :beers: Punk API code challenge :beers:

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

In order tu launch it, just clone the repository, enter the repo folder and install the dependencies with
```yarn install```.
Once it's done with the dependencies  start the dev server with ```yarn start```

## Considerations

- As css framework i've used bootstrap
- I took care of the responsiveness of the app
- I managed the missing image for the random beer, while in the search results i've used a placeholder image
