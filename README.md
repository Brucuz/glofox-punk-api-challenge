This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App]

In order tu launch it, just clone the repository, enter the repo folder and install the dependencies:
```yarn install```
and start the dev server
```yarn start```

## Considerations

- As css framework i've used bootstrap
- I took care of the responsiveness of the app
- I managed the missing image for the random beer, while in the search results i've used a placeholder image
